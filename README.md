# CustomGUI
A Minecraft plugin api that aims at easing in-game gui development

## Introduction
The project aims at reducing long repetitive code when creating a simple inventory gui by using java reflection and annotations. This method allows for better human readability and offloads input handling to the api internally so you don't have to handle it. Although unfinished at the moment, I look forward to completing this over the summer break.

## Technologies
* JavaSE 14
* CustomCommand 0.1
* Spigot 1.16.5
